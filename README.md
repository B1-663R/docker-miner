## How to

README.md on each folder

## Dependencies

As described in the NVIDIA Docker Architecture, you need to install
- NVIDIA Drivers
- NVIDIA Docker
- Linux rig

CUDA Toolkit and other files are included on each miner docker image

## Notes

Commands for each miner are available on each repo

I recommend to run the images in attached mode using a terminal window manager like tmux or screen. so you can easly login into your machine and re-attach your session.
